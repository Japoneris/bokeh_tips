# Bokeh Tips and Tricks

This repository contains some projects using [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/).

As the documentation is sometimes shady, here you will have some examples in the real world.

*Note*: The projects are not "here, this tool works like this". I have project where I use bokeh at some points, but it is not the cornerstone. These projects are too small to get a dedicated repository.


# Projects

- [Maze](maze/): This is a "maze" generator. You start from one page, you select one option, and move to another page.
- [Exam](exam/): How to make an exam where it is difficult to cheat.
- [Swarm](swarm/): Modeling a grid / spin / swarm behavior, and display the different steps using a bokeh slider.
