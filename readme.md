# Bokeh Tips and Trics

This repository contains some projects using [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/).

As the documentation is sometimes shady, here you will have some examples in the real world.

*Note*: The projects are not "here, this tool works like this". I have project where I use bokeh at some points, but it is not the cornerstone. These projects are too small to get a dedicated repository.
